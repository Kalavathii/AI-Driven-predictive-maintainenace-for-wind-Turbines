Detailed Technical Description
File: app.py
The app.py file is a central script likely responsible for running the main application. This file typically includes importing necessary libraries, initializing the application, and defining various routes and functions to handle user requests. The script might also include configurations and utility functions that are essential for the application's operations.

Key Components:

Imports and Configurations: The script starts by importing necessary libraries such as Flask, Pandas, and other utilities required for the application. It also sets up configurations such as secret keys and database connections.
Application Initialization: The Flask application is initialized, setting up the app instance and configuring necessary parameters.
Routes Definition: Several routes are defined to handle different functionalities of the application. These routes correspond to various endpoints that users can interact with.
Utility Functions: Functions that perform specific tasks such as data processing, database interactions, and utility functions to support the main operations.
File: EDA.py
The EDA.py file is dedicated to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset. EDA is a crucial step in data science projects where data is summarized and visualized to understand its structure, main characteristics, and potential relationships.

Key Components:

Data Loading: The script starts by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Steps to clean the data, handle missing values, and correct data types are included.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculation of basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and other relevant metrics for each feature.
Data Visualization: Various plots and charts are created to visualize the data distribution, relationships between features, and potential anomalies.
Insights and Observations: The script might include code to derive insights and observations based on the EDA findings, helping in further analysis and model building.
File: train.py
The train.py file is focused on training machine learning models using the dataset. This file typically includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use.

Key Components:

Imports and Data Loading: The script imports necessary libraries for machine learning, such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, and loads the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Steps to preprocess the data, such as normalization, encoding categorical variables, splitting data into training and testing sets, and handling class imbalance if any.
Model Definition and Training: Defining the machine learning model(s) to be trained. This includes specifying model parameters, compiling the model, and training it using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and others.
Model Saving: Saving the trained model to a file for later use in making predictions or further analysis.
Dataset: wind_turbine_maintenance_data.csv
The wind_turbine_maintenance_data.csv dataset contains data related to wind turbine operations and maintenance. The dataset includes various features that are crucial for predicting maintenance needs and identifying anomalies.

Dataset Features:

Turbine_ID: Unique identifier for each wind turbine.
Wind_Speed: The speed of the wind measured in meters per second.
Rotor_Speed: The rotational speed of the turbine's rotor.
Power_Output: The power output generated by the turbine measured in kilowatts.
Temperature: The temperature near the turbine measured in degrees Celsius.
Vibration: The vibration level of the turbine measured in some unit.
Turbine_Age: The age of the turbine in years.
Maintenance_History: A binary indicator of whether the turbine has undergone maintenance (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Anomaly: A binary indicator of whether there is an anomaly (1 for yes, 0 for no).
